# Green Stocks Analysis

### Overview of Project
The purpose of this project (done using Excel and VBA) is to analyze stock data from several companies from years 2017 and 2018 by creating a table to show the returns for each ticker. This table could help our client make investment decisions. Finally, a review was made in order to refactor the VBA code to make it faster and more efficient.
## Results
Thanks to the conditional color formatting of the “Returns” column in the “All Stocks Analysis” table, we can see at a first glance that, in general, 2017 was more profitable than 2018. In contrast, during 2018 most companies experienced loses. The only company that shows an increase in value from 2017 to 2018 was RUN, as it went from 5.5% to an 84.0% return. 
### Summary
## The advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code
Refactoring enhances the performance of the code. It reduces the likelihood of errors, makes it easier to read and even replicate in future projects. A possible disadvantage is how time-consuming it is, and the chance of making mistakes that could affect the entirety of the code. 
## The pros and cons of refactoring the original VBA script
One of the cons was a faster run time, which means that the code is using less memory than the previous one. The original code took 1 second to run, whereas the refactored code took approximately 0.17 seconds. As for the cons, time could be an issue. I spent more hours refactoring the code than writing the original code, as I had to conduct a research and run several tests.
